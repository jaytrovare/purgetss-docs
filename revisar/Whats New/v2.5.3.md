# What's new in v2.5.3

## `zIndex` utilities
Utilities for controlling the stack order of an element.
```css
// Component(s): Ti.UI.Animation, Ti.UI.View
// Property(ies): zIndex
'.z-0': { zIndex: 0 }
'.z-10': { zIndex: 10 }
'.z-20': { zIndex: 20 }
'.z-30': { zIndex: 30 }
'.z-40': { zIndex: 40 }
'.z-50': { zIndex: 50 }
```


## Boxicons Font v2.0.9!
Added a beatufil library of icons called [Boxicons](https://boxicons.com).

A High Quality web friendly icons

'Boxicons' is a carefully designed open source iconset with 1500+ icons. It's crafted to look enrich your website/app experience.

To copy the new font file to your project use:

```bash
> purgetss fonts --vendor="boxicons"

# alias:
> purgetss f -v=bx
```

Add the `--modules` flag to also copy the corresponding CommonJS module into `./app/lib/` folder:

```bash
> purgetss fonts --vendor="boxicons" --modules

# alias:
> purgetss f -v=bx -m
```

We are keeping the prefixes of boxicons classes in the `boxicons.js` file to prevent unexpected results, because there are three sets of icons in the same font file: **Logos, Regular and Solid**.
- Regular: `bx-flag` becomes `bxFlag`
- Solid: `bxs-flag` becomes `bxsFlag`
- Logos: Almost all the logos have no conflict with other classes, because almost all have unique names, except for one: `bxl-windows` and `bx-windows`. That's why we are also keeping the prefix for all `logos` variants, so they become: `bxlWindows` for example.
